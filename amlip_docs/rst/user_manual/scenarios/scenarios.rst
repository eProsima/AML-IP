################
AML-IP Scenarios
################

The |amlip| framework is divided in different **scenarios** or **use cases**
that allow it to exploit all the capabilities :term:`AML`.
These scenarios work independently of each other and make sense separately,
but can be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a more complex network.
Each of the scenarios rely on a different set of **Nodes** that perform the different actions required.

In order to know more about the *Node* concept and their kinds, please refer to :ref:`user_manual_nodes` section.
