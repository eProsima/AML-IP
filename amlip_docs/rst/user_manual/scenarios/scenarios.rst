AML-IP Scenarios
################

The |amlip| framework is divided in different **scenarios** or **use cases** to fulfill all the necessities
for an :term:`AML` network.
These scenarios work independently one to each other and make sense separately, but they can be perfectly integrated
one to each other in order to create a complex network.
Each of the scenarios rely on a different set of **Nodes** that perform the different actions required.

In order to know more about the *Node* concept and their kinds, refer to :ref:`user_manual_nodes` section.
