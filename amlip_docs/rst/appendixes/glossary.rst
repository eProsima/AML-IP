    NAT
        **Network Address Translation**:
        Typically an internet router multiplexes all the traffic through
        a public IP to several private IPs.
        Usually, the machines under the router network cannot be accessed from the outside unless a Port is forwarded
        in the router configuration, or if such host has previously started a TCP communication with the message source.
