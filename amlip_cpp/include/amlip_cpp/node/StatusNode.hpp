 * Status messages are sent by every Node publishing their id, kind and current state.
 * Every message of it could be processed by this Node. The use of these messages are left for the user to implement.
 * Some ideas of what to do with them:
 * - Debug purpose
 * - Store data in a DataBase that represents the state of the network and its changes.
 *
 * This Node has currently a method \c process_status_async that activates the processing of status data.
 * It can work with a Listener or by a callback that is executed with each message.
 * While this method is not called, messages will be stored in Reader.
 * Once called, each old message (except those that overflow the DDS internal history) are processed.
 *
 * @warning so far this class is not thread-safe, so \c process_status_async can only be called once, and cannot
 * be called again before calling \c stop_processing .
 *
 * @warning Not Thread Safe (yet) (TODO)
